Significance of Resource class:-

The Resources class allows you to manage different application data in a certain directory,providing a dictionary-style
access functionality for your in-application resources.

To access individual files, you do not need to concat paths the whole time and regardless of the current directory, 
your application operates on, you can access your resource files at any time through the Resources instance, 
you created initially.

The Resources class is also able to scan an index archived files, compressed via ZIP or TAR, and 
subdiectories automatically.
The Resources class manages a set of file resources and eases accessing them by using relative paths, scanning 
archives automatically and so on.


Job of dispatch_request method :-
                                    The dispatch_request method is one of the first method called during the request. 
Not surprisingly, it handles dispatching the request to the proper request handler. Overriding this method allows you 
to see what exactly is getting sent to your application, and what exactly is being sent back in the responce. This might 
be useful if you are seeing unexpected session creation.
